      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I’m Oghenemarho Omasan, an up-and-coming web developer with a rich background in project 
        management, business analysis, and data-driven problem-solving. My career journey started with a 
        Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering and has evolved through roles in consulting and 
        analysis, where I developed a strong foundation in leadership, stakeholder management, and process 
        improvement. These experiences have uniquely prepared me to tackle the challenges of web development.</p>
      
      <p>Over the years, I’ve led diverse projects at organizations like Deloitte & Touche and First Bank of 
        Nigeria, where I managed feasibility studies, technical assessments, and strategic initiatives. 
        I honed my ability to break down complex problems, build effective strategies, and drive projects to 
        success—skills that are just as critical in coding and building digital solutions. I’ve seen 
        firsthand how clear communication, meticulous planning, and analytical thinking can transform ideas 
        into impactful results.</p>
      
      <p>Now, I am channeling my expertise into the world of web development. I am passionate about creating 
        functional, intuitive, and visually appealing websites that not only look great but also deliver 
        real value to users. Whether I’m learning a new front-end framework or exploring back-end integration, 
        I bring the same dedication and detail-oriented approach that has defined my career thus far.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to my technical and analytical skills, I’m a creative problem-solver who loves blending 
        design with functionality. My background in data analysis and business process modeling means I 
        approach development with a keen eye for detail and efficiency. I’m continuously expanding my skill set,
         exploring modern web technologies, and building projects that showcase my growing expertise.</p>
      
      <p>When I’m not coding or refining my skills, I immerse myself in photography, digital art, and 
        music—creative pursuits that inspire my approach to design and user experience. I believe that 
        technology and creativity go hand in hand, and I’m excited to bring that fusion to every project I 
        work on.</p>
      
      <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating on exciting new projects!</p>
